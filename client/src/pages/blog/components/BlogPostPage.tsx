    title: 'Independent contractor or employee? How to classify your workers',
    content: `
      Classifying your workers properly is crucial to remain compliant with IRS and labor laws.
      Independent contractors typically control how they complete tasks, supply their own tools, and take on multiple clients.
      Employees, on the other hand, follow company schedules, receive training, and use provided resources.
      Misclassification can result in costly fines and tax liabilities.
      Learn how to evaluate behavioral control, financial control, and the relationship between you and your workers to classify them correctly.
